# ClusterAnalyzer

ClusterAnalyzer is a Python library designed to analyze critical behavior, self-similarity, and fractal dimensions of clusters in cellular automata. It provides tools for simulating cluster formation, performing statistical analyses, and visualizing results.

## Features
- Optimized clusted detection
- Simulate Logistic Game of Life (LGOL) and find polynomial solutions.
- Analyze cluster sizes and their distributions.
- Perform power-law fitting and goodness-of-fit tests and visualizations based on [powerlaw package](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085777) developed in on the statistical methods developed in [Clauset et al. 2007](https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062) and [Klaus et al. 2011](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019779).
- Generate Probability Density Function (PDF) and Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) plots.
   

## Installation

You can install ClusterAnalyzer via pip:

```bash
